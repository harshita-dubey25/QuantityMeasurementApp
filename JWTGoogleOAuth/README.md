# 📏 QuantityMeasurementApp

> A Java-based **Spring Boot REST application** developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and evolve a multi-category quantity measurement system. The project emphasizes incremental development, clean object-oriented design, and continuous architectural refactoring to build a scalable, flexible, and maintainable domain model.

### 📖 Overview

- Modular **Spring Boot-based Java application** focused on modelling multi-category quantity measurements (length, weight, volume, and temperature) with full conversion and controlled arithmetic support.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases evolving from simple equality checks to a **scalable, capability-aware and layered (N-Tier) architecture**.
- Emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainable structure through **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and continuous refactoring.

  - Introduces `ConnectionPool` utility class that manages a pool of reusable JDBC connections for efficient resource usage.
  - Extends `IQuantityMeasurementRepository` interface with four new methods: `getMeasurementsByOperation()`, `getMeasurementsByType()`, `getTotalCount()`, and `deleteAll()`.
  - Adds `DatabaseException` to the custom exception hierarchy, with static factory methods for structured database error handling.
  - Adopts **parameterized SQL queries** (`PreparedStatement`) throughout the database repository to prevent SQL injection attacks.
  - Migrates all `System.out.println` logging to **Java's built-in `java.util.logging` (JUL)** framework via SLF4J and Logback.

- 🧩 **UC17 – Spring Boot Integration with REST Services and JPA Persistence :**
  - Migrates the entire application from a standalone JDBC-based design to a **Spring Boot REST service** while preserving all domain models and business logic from UC1–UC16.
  - Introduces `QuantityMeasurementApplication` as the **Spring Boot entry point** with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@OpenAPIDefinition` for application metadata.
  - **Replaces manual JDBC repositories** (`QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository`, `QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository`, `ApplicationConfig`, `ConnectionPool`) with **Spring Data JPA** — `QuantityMeasurementRepository` extending `JpaRepository<QuantityMeasurementEntity, Long>`.
  - `QuantityMeasurementRepository` defines derived-query methods: `findByOperation`, `findByThisMeasurementType`, `findByCreatedAtAfter`, `countByOperationAndErrorFalse`, `findByErrorTrue`, and a custom `@Query` method `findSuccessfulByOperation`.
  - **Refactors the package layout** — introduces three distinct packages: `entity` for JPA-mapped database classes (`QuantityMeasurementEntity`), `dto` for API request/response objects (`QuantityDTO`, `QuantityInputDTO`, `QuantityMeasurementDTO`), and `model` for pure domain/business objects (`Quantity`, `QuantityModel`, `OperationType`).
  - **Refactors `QuantityDTO`** to include Bean Validation annotations (`@Data`, `@NotNull`, `@NotEmpty`, `@Pattern`, `@AssertTrue`) enforcing input integrity at the API boundary.
  - Introduces **`QuantityMeasurementDTO`** as a structured API response object with static factory methods: `fromEntity()`, `toEntity()`, `fromEntityList()`, and `toEntityList()` using the Java Stream API for efficient collection mapping.
  - Adds **`QuantityInputDTO`** to encapsulate the two-operand input structure accepted by all POST endpoints.
  - Introduces **`OperationType` enum** with constants `ADD`, `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `DIVIDE`, `COMPARE`, and `CONVERT` for type-safe operation representation throughout the application.
  - **Exposes RESTful API endpoints** through `QuantityMeasurementController` using `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping("/api/v1/quantities")`:
    - `POST /compare`, `/convert`, `/add`, `/subtract`, `/divide` — accept `QuantityInputDTO`, return `QuantityMeasurementDTO`.
    - `GET /history/operation/{operation}`, `/history/type/{measurementType}`, `/history/errored` — return `List<QuantityMeasurementDTO>`.
    - `GET /count/{operation}` — returns operation count.
  - Adds **Swagger/OpenAPI annotations** (`@Operation`, `@Tag`, `@Parameter`) on all controller methods to generate interactive API documentation.
  - Implements **centralized exception handling** via `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@ControllerAdvice`) with handlers for `MethodArgumentNotValidException`, `QuantityMeasurementException`, and general `Exception` — returning structured JSON error responses with timestamp, status, error type, message, and path.
  - **Removes `DatabaseException`** — exception handling is now managed declaratively through `GlobalExceptionHandler` and Spring's exception translation layer.
  - Adds **`SecurityConfig`** in a dedicated `config` package preparing the system for Spring Security integration; currently permits all requests for development and testing.
  - Supports **environment-based configuration** through `application.properties` (H2, development) and `application-prod.properties` (MySQL, production), replacing the custom `ApplicationConfig` and manual property loading from UC16.
  - **HikariCP** is used as the default connection pool (auto-configured by Spring Boot), replacing the manual `ConnectionPool` implementation from UC16.
  - **Schema is managed by JPA auto-DDL** (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` in dev), replacing the explicit `schema.sql` from UC16.
  - Adds **Spring Boot Actuator** for monitoring via `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, and `/actuator/metrics`.
  - Adds comprehensive **Spring Boot testing**:
    - `QuantityMeasurementControllerTest` — controller unit tests using `@WebMvcTest` and `MockMvc`.
    - `QuantityMeasurementApplicationTests` — full-stack integration tests using `@SpringBootTest` and `TestRestTemplate`.
    - `QuantityMeasurementServiceIntegrationTest` — service-layer integration tests using `@SpringBootTest`.
    - `QuantityMeasurementRepositoryTest` — Spring Data JPA repository tests.
  - Demonstrates migration from **JDBC-based persistence (UC16)** to a modern **Spring Boot + JPA enterprise architecture** while maintaining the original measurement logic and full test coverage.

- 🧩 **UC18 – Spring Security with JWT Authentication, Google/GitHub OAuth2 & Industry-Standard Refactoring:**
  - Activates full **Spring Security** with JWT, Google OAuth2, and GitHub OAuth2 authentication, secured REST endpoints, role-based authorization, and complete security-focused test coverage.
  - Introduces a `security` package containing `JwtTokenProvider`, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint`, `JwtAccessDeniedHandler`, `CustomUserDetailsService`, `UserPrincipal`, `CustomOAuth2UserService`, `OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler`, and `OAuth2AuthenticationFailureHandler`.
  - **JWT lifecycle** — `JwtTokenProvider` generates signed HS256 tokens from authenticated principals, extracts email and role claims, and validates tokens on every request; configured via `app.jwt.secret` (Base64-encoded) and `app.jwt.expiration-ms` in `application.properties`.
  - **Local authentication** — `AuthController` (`/api/v1/auth`) exposes `POST /register` (BCrypt-hash password, persist `User`, return JWT), `POST /login` (verify credentials, return JWT), `GET /me` (return profile of authenticated user), `PUT /forgotPassword/{email}` (reset password without prior authentication), and `PUT /resetPassword/{email}` (reset password while authenticated). All HTTP-handling concerns are kept in the controller; business logic is delegated to `AuthenticationService`.
  - Introduces `AuthenticationService` as a dedicated service class encapsulating all authentication business logic — user registration, credential verification, JWT issuance, and password management — keeping `AuthController` thin and single-responsibility.
  - Adds `EmailService` for async (`@Async`) SMTP email notifications on authentication events (registration, login, and password changes); configured via `spring.mail.*` properties and backed by `spring-boot-starter-mail`.
  - Adds `ForgotPasswordRequest` DTO (with `@NotBlank`, `@Pattern` constraints) for the forgot/reset password request payload, and `MessageResponse` DTO as a lightweight wrapper for human-readable status messages returned by password-management endpoints.
  - Introduces `CorsConfig` in the `config` package providing a centralised `CorsConfigurationSource` bean consumed by Spring Security's CORS filter; allowed origins are configurable per environment via `app.cors.allowed-origins` in profile-specific property files.
  - **Google OAuth2** — Spring Security's built-in OAuth2 login filter handles the Authorization Code flow (`/oauth2/authorization/google`); `CustomOAuth2UserService` resolves the Google profile to a local `User` (create-or-update), and `OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler` issues a JWT redirect to the configured frontend URI.
  - **GitHub OAuth2** — identical flow at `/oauth2/authorization/github`; `CustomOAuth2UserService` dispatches on the `registrationId` and applies GitHub-specific attribute extraction (`id` → `providerId`, `login` as name fallback, `avatar_url` as image). GitHub's `email` field may be `null` when the user's primary email is private; the service rejects such logins with a descriptive error. Requires `read:user,user:email` scope and a GitHub OAuth App registered at https://github.com/settings/developers.
  - Introduces `User` JPA entity (table `app_user`) with fields: `email`, `name`, `password` (nullable for OAuth2), `provider` (`AuthProvider` enum: `LOCAL`/`GOOGLE`/`GITHUB`), `providerId`, `role` (`Role` enum: `USER`/`ADMIN`), `imageUrl`, and `createdAt` (set via `@PrePersist`).
  - Adds `UserRepository` (Spring Data JPA) with `existsByEmail()` and `findByEmail()` derived queries.
  - Adds `AuthRequest`, `AuthResponse` (Builder pattern), and `RegisterRequest` DTOs with Bean Validation constraints (`@NotBlank`, `@Email`, `@Size`).
  - **Role-based access control** via `@EnableMethodSecurity` and URL-level rules: public auth/OAuth2/Swagger/Actuator endpoints; `USER`+`ADMIN` for all quantity operations; `ADMIN` only for `GET /api/v1/quantities/history/errored`.
  - **STATELESS session policy** — no HTTP session is ever created; CSRF disabled; HTTP Basic and form login disabled.
  - `SecurityConfig` registers `DaoAuthenticationProvider` (BCrypt + `CustomUserDetailsService`), exposes `AuthenticationManager` as a bean, and inserts `JwtAuthenticationFilter` before `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.
  - Adds `app.jwt.secret`, `app.jwt.expiration-ms`, `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.*`, and `app.oauth2.redirect-uri` to `application.properties` (all resolved from environment variables in production).
  - Adds comprehensive **unit and integration test coverage for authentication and security components** ensuring correctness of JWT generation, user principal resolution, DTO validation, repository interaction, and controller endpoints.
  - Introduces new test classes validating authentication workflows:

    - `AuthControllerTest`
      - Tests `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/login`, `/me`, `/forgotPassword`, and `/resetPassword` endpoints using `@WebMvcTest`.
      - Verifies request validation, JWT response structure, and authentication behaviour.

    - `JwtTokenProviderTest`
      - Validates JWT creation, parsing, claim extraction, expiration handling, and signature verification.
      - Ensures tokens are securely generated using HS256 algorithm and Base64 secret.

    - `UserPrincipalTest`
      - Verifies Spring Security `UserDetails` mapping from `User` entity.
      - Ensures roles and authorities are correctly exposed to the security context.

    - `UserRepositoryTest`
      - Validates Spring Data JPA derived query methods:
        - `existsByEmail`
        - `findByEmail`
      - Confirms persistence behaviour for LOCAL and GOOGLE authentication providers.

    - `AuthDTOTest`
      - Validates Bean Validation constraints on:
        - `AuthRequest`
        - `RegisterRequest`
        - `AuthResponse`
        - `ForgotPasswordRequest`
      - Verifies structure and accessor behaviour for `MessageResponse` (constructor, getter, setter).
      - Ensures email format, password constraints, and required fields are enforced.

    - `AuthenticationServiceTest`
      - Validates authentication business logic in `AuthenticationService`.
      - Covers registration, login, JWT issuance, and password-management behaviour.

    - `EmailServiceTest`
      - Verifies async email dispatch for registration, login, and password-change events.
      - Uses mocked `JavaMailSender` to assert correct email construction without SMTP interaction.

    - `CustomOAuth2UserServiceTest`
      - Tests OAuth2 login processing for **GOOGLE** and **GITHUB** providers.
      - Verifies user registration, profile update, provider conflict handling, null email validation (GitHub private email case), and correct `UserPrincipal` mapping.

    - Updated `QuantityMeasurementApplicationTests`
      - Ensures full Spring Boot context loads correctly with Security configuration enabled.
      - Verifies compatibility between SecurityFilterChain, JPA, Controllers, and OAuth2 configuration.

    - Updated `QuantityMeasurementControllerTest`
      - Ensures secured endpoints are accessible only with valid JWT authentication.
      - Uses Spring Security test support (`@WithMockUser`, MockMvc JWT setup).

  - Demonstrates **security-focused TDD approach** ensuring:
    - Authentication logic correctness
    - JWT integrity
    - OAuth2 user mapping reliability
    - Role-based authorization behaviour
    - Backward compatibility with existing quantity measurement features

  - Performs a comprehensive architectural and code-quality refactoring of the UC18 codebase to align with professional Java / Spring Boot industry conventions.
  - **Switches logging from `java.util.logging` (JUL) to SLF4J via Lombok's `@Slf4j`** across all main source files — eliminates every `Logger.getLogger(...)` field declaration, adds `@Slf4j` class annotation, and replaces all `logger.*()` call sites with the equivalent `log.*()` SLF4J calls.
  - **Restructures the `dto` package** into explicit `request` and `response` sub-packages:
    - `dto/request/` — `AuthRequest`, `RegisterRequest`, `ForgotPasswordRequest`, `QuantityInputDTO`, `QuantityMeasurementDTO`
    - `dto/response/` — `AuthResponse`, `MessageResponse`, `QuantityDTO`
  - **Restructures the `security` package** into explicit `jwt` and `oauth2` sub-packages:
    - `security/jwt/` — `JwtTokenProvider`, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint`, `JwtAccessDeniedHandler`
    - `security/oauth2/` — `CustomOAuth2UserService`, `OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler`, `OAuth2AuthenticationFailureHandler`
    - `security/` (root) — `CustomUserDetailsService`, `UserPrincipal`
  - **Introduces an `enums` package** by extracting `AuthProvider`, `Role`, and `OperationType` from the `model` package into a dedicated `enums` package, separating pure enum types from domain model classes.
  - **Adds profile-specific `application-dev.properties` and `application-test.properties`** alongside the existing base `application.properties` and `application-prod.properties`, completing the full four-profile configuration set (base / dev / prod / test).
  - **Updates all cross-file imports** throughout main and test source trees to reference the correct new package paths for every moved class.
  - **Renames test `integrationTests/` package to `integration/`** and relocates `QuantityMeasurementServiceIntegrationTest` from `service/` into `integration/` to match the target structure.
  - **Cleans up `.gitignore`** — removes duplicate entries and adds `application-prod.properties` and `.env` to the secrets ignore list.
  - **Updates `pom.xml`** — extracts `${lombok.version}` property so the version is declared once and referenced in both the `<dependency>` block and the `maven-compiler-plugin` annotationProcessorPaths.
  - All existing UC1–UC17 functionality, tests, and API contracts are fully preserved; this UC contains no functional changes — only structural and quality improvements.

> **Note on UC17 → UC18 changes:**
> The permissive `SecurityConfig` stub introduced in UC17 was fully replaced in UC18 with a **production-ready stateless Spring Security configuration** supporting **JWT authentication and Google OAuth2 login**.  
> This builds on top of UC18 with a **structural and code-quality refactoring** — no API changes, only improved package organisation, SLF4J logging, and profile-based configuration.
 The permissive `SecurityConfig` stub introduced in UC17 has been fully replaced with a **production-ready stateless Spring Security configuration** supporting **JWT authentication and Google OAuth2 login**.  
> All existing UC17 functionality remains intact; UC18 extends the architecture with authentication, authorization, and security-focused validation layers.

> **Updated Components**
> - `SecurityConfig.java` → UPDATED: implements stateless `SecurityFilterChain`, disables session creation, configures endpoint authorization rules, and integrates JWT + OAuth2 filters
> - `application.properties` → UPDATED: adds JWT, Google OAuth2, and **GitHub OAuth2** configuration properties
> - `application-prod.properties` → UPDATED: adds `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable entries
> - `QuantityMeasurementControllerTest` → UPDATED: validates secured endpoints with authentication context
> - `QuantityMeasurementApplicationTests` → UPDATED: verifies application context loads successfully with Spring Security enabled

> **Security Package (UC18 structure)**
> - `security/jwt/` sub-package (UC18):
>   - `JwtTokenProvider` → JWT generation, parsing, validation, claim extraction
>   - `JwtAuthenticationFilter` → intercepts requests and sets authentication context
>   - `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint` → handles unauthorized access attempts (401)
>   - `JwtAccessDeniedHandler` → handles insufficient permission scenarios (403)
> - `security/oauth2/` sub-package (UC18):
>   - `CustomOAuth2UserService` → maps Google OAuth2 user profile to application user
>   - `OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler` → generates JWT after successful OAuth2 login
>   - `OAuth2AuthenticationFailureHandler` → handles OAuth2 authentication failures
> - `security/` root (UC18):
>   - `CustomUserDetailsService` → loads user-specific data for authentication
>   - `UserPrincipal` → Spring Security compliant authenticated user representation

> **New Authentication Domain Components**
> - `User` entity → stores user identity, provider details, role, and profile metadata
> - `UserRepository` → Spring Data JPA repository supporting lookup by email
> - DTO layer additions:
>   - `AuthRequest` → login request payload
>   - `RegisterRequest` → user registration payload
>   - `AuthResponse` → JWT authentication response
>   - `ForgotPasswordRequest` → new/replacement password payload for forgot/reset password endpoints
>   - `MessageResponse` → lightweight wrapper for human-readable status messages
> - Authorization model additions (moved to `enums/` in UC18):
>   - `Role` enum → defines USER and ADMIN roles
>   - `AuthProvider` enum → distinguishes LOCAL, GOOGLE, and GITHUB authentication sources
>   - `OperationType` enum → type-safe operation constants (also moved to `enums/` in UC18)

> **New Test Coverage (UC18)**
> - Adds dedicated test classes validating authentication flow and security behaviour:
>   - `AuthControllerTest` → verifies register, login, authenticated profile, and password-management endpoints
>   - `AuthenticationServiceTest` → validates authentication business logic (registration, login, JWT issuance, password management)
>   - `EmailServiceTest` → verifies async email dispatch for authentication events using a mocked `JavaMailSender`
>   - `JwtTokenProviderTest` → validates token creation, signature verification, and expiration handling
>   - `CustomOAuth2UserServiceTest` → tests OAuth2 user processing logic for Google and GitHub providers
>   - `UserPrincipalTest` → verifies correct mapping of User → UserDetails
>   - `UserRepositoryTest` → validates repository queries for user lookup and existence checks
>   - `AuthDTOTest` → validates Bean Validation constraints on authentication request DTOs (including `ForgotPasswordRequest`) and verifies `MessageResponse` structure/accessors
>   - `UserRepositoryTest` → extended with GitHub provider tests: `findByProviderAndProviderId(GITHUB)`, provider isolation (GitHub vs Google with same numeric ID), null-name fallback, `createdAt` and `providerId` persistence
>   - `UserTest` → extended with GitHub builder tests: full field population, null-name fallback to login username, `toString` safety
>   - Updated integration and controller tests ensure compatibility between Spring Security, JPA, and REST endpoints

> UC18 establishes a **secure, stateless authentication architecture** aligned with modern Spring Boot practices while preserving full backward compatibility with the measurement domain logic developed in UC1–UC17.

> **UC18 – Refactoring Summary**
> - **Logging:** all classes switched from `java.util.logging.Logger` to Lombok `@Slf4j`; no functional change, consistent log output
> - **`dto` restructured:** request DTOs in `dto/request/`, response DTOs in `dto/response/`; `ForgotPasswordRequest` and `MessageResponse` added for password-management endpoints
> - **`security` restructured:** JWT classes in `security/jwt/`, OAuth2 classes in `security/oauth2/`
> - **`enums` introduced:** `AuthProvider`, `Role`, `OperationType` extracted from `model/` into a dedicated `enums/` package
> - **`integrationTests/` renamed** to `integration/`; `QuantityMeasurementServiceIntegrationTest` moved from `service/` to `integration/`
> - **Profile-based config completed:** `application-dev.properties` and `application-test.properties` added alongside existing `application.properties` and `application-prod.properties`
> - **`pom.xml`:** `${lombok.version}` property extracted; Lombok `@Slf4j` documented
> - **`AuthenticationService`** introduced to hold authentication business logic, keeping `AuthController` thin
> - **`EmailService`** added for async SMTP email notifications; `spring-boot-starter-mail` added to `pom.xml`
> - **`CorsConfig`** added in `config/` package for centralised, environment-configurable CORS policy
> - **`pom.xml`:** `${lombok.version}` property extracted; Lombok `@Slf4j` documented; `spring-boot-starter-mail` added
> - **`.gitignore`:** duplicates removed; `application-prod.properties` and `.env` added to secrets exclusions

### ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

- Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
- Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
- Each Use Case introduces new functionality in small, controlled steps.
- Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
- Design evolves toward clean, maintainable, and well-tested software.
- Later use cases introduce capability-based behavior where different measurement categories support different operations safely.
